## Code of Excellence

Mr. Hameetman is a highly professional and dedicated Engineer. He
takes seriously his obligation to the engineering and technology-
focused communities he serves. To make sure he meets those obligations,
Mr. Hameetman has established this Code of Excellence for contributors
which is designed to articulate the ethical standards that serve as
the cornerstone for the community’s activities – its principles,
philosophies, mission and vision – and describe how they affect
everyday behaviors and actions of its individuals.

The Code of Excellence is a program designed to bring out the best in
the Engineers who contribute to this project and demonstrate to others that
we:

- Perform the highest quality of Software Engineering work
- Lead by example to promote strict adherence to industry standards
  and best practices
- Execute tasks by putting craftsmanship first

The Code of Excellence is therefore a written policy of the culture of the
ShadowUI community designed to instill a sense of pride and professionalism
throughout the project. When adopted and implemented, the uniformity of this
Code of Excellence shall demonstrate to prospective and current contributors
that contributing to the ShadowUI project is synonymous with
contributing excellence.

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming culture of learning,
we pledge to practice our profession with the highest level of
integrity and competence. We pledge to be honest about our limitations,
continuously seeking to improve our skills through life-long learning.

- We shall exercise careful consideration of the correct balance
  between quality and productivity.

- We shall not tremble in the face of a large refactor.

- We shall strive to include meaningful tests and documentation in our
  Pull Requests whenever possible to protect the integrity of the
  project.

- We shall make participation in our projects and our community a
  harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
  size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level
  of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or
  sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive
culture of learning include:

- Writing organized, carefully-considered, well-documented code
- Writing meaninful tests
- Showing respect and empathy while providing constructive feedback
  in code review

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Writing sloppy, disorganized, overly verbose, or overly-engineered
  code
- Not including tests or including only basic tests
- Not including documentation or including only basic documentation
- Communicating with disrespect when discussing features or issues or
  when reviewing code
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in
  a professional setting

Any Pull Requests which do not meet these standards may be rejected with
or without notice at the Project Owner's discretion.

### Our Responsibilities

The Project Owner is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and is expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unprofessional conduct.

The Project Owner has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Excellence, or to ban temporarily or permanently any

Pull Requests. The Project Owner has the right to deny, reject, or remove any
contribution at any time for any reason, with or without notice to the
contributor.

### Scope

This Code of Excellence applies in all ShadowUI project spaces when an
individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official ShadowUI e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by the Project Owner.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unprofessional conduct
may be reported by emailing the Project Owner at
